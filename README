🧠 Job Application Assistant AI Bot

An AI-powered assistant that automatically fills out repeated questions in job applications across Workday job portals, based on your previously submitted answers.

This tool is designed to reduce repetitive work by recognizing common application forms, auto-filling known responses, and streamlining the job application process.



🚀 Features

 🔁 Reusable Answer Engine 
  Remembers your responses to common questions and auto-fills them on similar forms.

 🧠 LLM-Enhanced Question Matching  
  Uses GPT-4 to classify and match similar questions across different job portals.

 🤖 Automated Form Filling
  Navigates and fills job application forms using Puppeteer for Workday-based job sites.

 ☁️ Cloud Backend (GCP)  
  Stores Q&A pairs using Google Cloud Firestore and handles backend tasks with Cloud Functions.



🛠️ Tech Stack

 Languages: Python, Node.js  
 AI: GPT-4 (OpenAI API)  
 Automation: Puppeteer (Node.js)  
 Cloud: Google Cloud Functions, Firestore  
 Database: Firestore (NoSQL)


 📝 How It Works

1. User manually answers questions in the first Workday job application.
2. Bot stores these Q&A pairs securely.
3. When the user visits a new job application with similar questions, the bot auto-fills the answers.
4. GPT-4 is used to detect minor variations in question wording and apply the correct stored answers.



📦 Project Status

- ✅ Q&A storage and retrieval complete  
- ✅ Workday form parsing and Puppeteer-based automation in place  
- 🔄 GPT-4 integration for semantic question matching in progress  
- ⏳ Currently supports **Workday only** (support for more portals planned)
